# 100daysofmlcode-farhankarim
Repository to share progress of 100daysofmlcode challenge by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo). I have taken up this challenge with a bit of a twist. Since i am fairly new to  DS/ML and have dedicated more than 5+ hours in studying per day .So, rather than spending 1 hour per day learning ML i will use that 1 hour to implement the topics i have learned that day in form of a Jupyter Notebook.

## Day1

1. **Pick an industry:** Housing
2. **Find a problem:** Predict the final price of each home in test set.
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Boston Housing](Data/Day%201%20-%20Linear%20Regression%20-%20Boston%20Housing%20Prices/USA_Housing.csv)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** Linear Regression in sklearn
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day1/Day1-Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

## Day2

1. **Pick an industry:** Shipbuilding
2. **Find a problem:** Predict survival of passenger(s)
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Titanic](Data/Day%202%20-%20Logistic%20Regression%20-%20Titanic)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** Logistic Regression in sklearn
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day2/Day2%20-%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

## Day3

1. **Pick an industry:** Housing
2. **Find a problem:** Predict the final price of each home in test set.
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Boston Housing](Data/Day%201%20-%20Linear%20Regression%20-%20Boston%20Housing%20Prices/USA_Housing.csv)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** Linear Regression in Tensorflow
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day3/first_steps_with_tensor_flow.ipynb)

## Day4

1. **Pick an industry:** Health Care
2. **Find a problem:** Predict breast cancer class.
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Wisconsin Breast Cancer](Data/Day%204%20-%20KNN%20-%20Breast%20Cancer/breast-cancer-wisconsinclean.csv)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** KNN in sklearn
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day4/Day4%20-%20KNN.ipynb)

## Day6

1. **Pick an industry:** Banking
2. **Find a problem:** Analyze Lending Club's issued loans.
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Cleaned and Reduced Loan Data](Data/Day%206%20-%20DT%20and%20Random%20Forest%20-%20Lending%20Club/loan_data.csv)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** Decision Tree and Random Forests in sklearn
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day6/Day%206%20-%20DT%20and%20Random%20Forests.ipynb)
