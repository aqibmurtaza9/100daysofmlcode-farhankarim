# 100daysofmlcode-farhankarim
Repository to share progress of 100daysofmlcode challenge by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo). I have taken up this challenge with a bit of a twist. Since i am fairly new to  DS/ML and have dedicated more than 5+ hours in studying per day .So, rather than spending 1 hour per day learning ML i will use that 1 hour to implement the topics i have learned that day in form of a Jupyter Notebook.

## Day1

1. **Pick an industry:** Housing
2. **Find a problem:** Predict the final price of each home in test set.
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Boston Housing](Data/Day 1 - Linear Regression - Boston Housing Prices/USA_Housing.csv)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** Linear Regression in sklearn
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day1/Day1-Linear Regression.ipynb)

## Day2

1. **Pick an industry:** Shipbuilding
2. **Find a problem:** Predict survival of passenger(s)
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Titanic](Data/Day 2 - Logistic Regression - Titanic)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** Logistic Regression in sklearn
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day2/Day2 - Logistic Regression.ipynb)

## Day3

1. **Pick an industry:** Housing
2. **Find a problem:** Predict the final price of each home in test set.
3. **Locate a Dataset:** [Boston Housing](Data/Day 1 - Linear Regression - Boston Housing Prices/USA_Housing.csv)
4. **Apply AI to Data:** Linear Regression in Tensorflow
5. **Create a Solution:** [Solution](Day3/first_steps_with_tensor_flow.ipynb)
