# 100daysofmlcode-farhankarim
Repository to share progress of 100daysofmlcode challenge by [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQMBj1cWPo). I have taken up this challenge with a bit of a twist. Since i am fairly new to  DS/ML and have dedicated more than 5+ hours in studying per day .So, rather than spending 1 hour per day learning ML i will use that 1 hour to implement the topics i have learned that day in Jupyter Notebook or doing something related to DS/ML (reading,watching conference videos,tutorials,answering [quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Farhan-Karim-16) questions etc).
